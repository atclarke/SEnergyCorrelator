# SEnergyCorrelator [Under Construction]

A class to implement Peter Komiske's [Energy-Energy Correlator](https://github.com/pkomiske/EnergyEnergyCorrelators) library in the sPHENIX software stack. I intend to design this class in such a way that it can run in two modes: a **standalone** mode in which the class can be run in a ROOT macro on already produced [input](https://github.com/ruse-traveler/SCorrelatorJetTree), and a **complex** mode in which the class is run as a module on the sPHENIX node tree.
